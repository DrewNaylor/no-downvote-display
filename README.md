# no_downvote_display
Hides downvotes in Disqus. Currently available as a WebExtension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no_downvote_display/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nodownvotedisplay/kamllmjccehkagnboedgedodpneaippg?hl=en&gl=US). The Chrome version should also be installable in Vivaldi, Opera, and Chromium Edge if installing extensions from the Chrome Web Store is allowed.

Long description:
Hides the number of downvotes comments have in Disqus. May need to refresh any tabs with Disqus comments that were opened before installing the extension. Doesn't hide downvotes when viewing Disqus profiles.

Project not to be confused with [Disqus-Downvote-Display](https://github.com/andytuwm/Disqus-Downvote-Display).

This project is available under the MIT license since it's so simple.


Some stuff was based on the [manifest.json for disqus-auto-expand](https://github.com/John30013/disqus-auto-expand/blob/master/src/Firefox/manifest.json) to make sure that the Disqus embedded comment section would have the CSS applied to it, that being setting the downvote count to be hidden.
