# no_downvote_display
Hides downvotes in Disqus. Currently available as a WebExtension for Firefox, though it's not on the Mozilla Extensions site yet.

Project not to be confused with [Disqus-Downvote-Display](https://github.com/andytuwm/Disqus-Downvote-Display).

This project is available under the MIT license since it's so simple.


Some stuff was based on the [manifest.json for disqus-auto-expand](https://github.com/John30013/disqus-auto-expand/blob/master/src/Firefox/manifest.json) to make sure that the Disqus embedded comment section would have the CSS applied to it, that being setting the downvote count to be hidden.
